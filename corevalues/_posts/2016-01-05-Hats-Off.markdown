<b>Objectives:</b>
- Exercise creative thinking
- Work together to develop a plan
- Listen to instructions 
- Trust teammates

<b>Materials:</b>
- One or more hats that would fit any head

<b>Setup:</b>
Leave the hat on a table or start it on one student’s head

<b>Instructions to Team:</b>
Everyone must wear the hat at some point during the activity. You cannot use your hands to touch the hat at any time.
Get creative!

<b>Notes:</b>
The more unique the hat, the more fun and engaging the activity can become. Just about any “one size fits all” hat will work. If the team has a fun hat that they wear for competition, use of the hat can be a great way to build team spirit and identity. This activity is a lot of fun in larger groups.
