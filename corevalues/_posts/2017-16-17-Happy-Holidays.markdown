<b>Objectives:</b>
- Collaborating on a physical task
- Coordinating movements

<b>Materials:</b>
- Boxes
- Wrapping Paper
- Scissors
- Tape

<b>Setup:</b>
Leave items on table jumbled.

<b>Instructions to Team:</b>
Your team has to wrap as many gifts as possible in 10 minutes. Each member of the team can only do one task (and only touch that one item - paper, scissors, tape, box).  Work together to wrap as many presents as you can.

<b>Notes:</b>
1) If you have a larger team, add some more items such as ribbons, name on the gift, etc.
2) Make the task longer if you need to.
2) Variations: Wrap the present but everyone can only use one hand, one blindfolded is the only one allowed to wrap (everyone else can see), wrap without talking.  (Credit for alternative ideas: Karla Stevens)
