        <span>EV3Lessons is run by FRC Team Not the Droids You Are Looking For. It was founded in 2014 as a way to share high-quality, open-source MINDSTORMS programming lessons. They are also the primary authors of
          the lessons. Their first mission is to provide all robotics students with a good starting point for coding well. They provide the building blocks for success. A second goal is to create a community where MINDSTORMS EV3 users (FIRST LEGO League teams and individuals) share and learn together. Today, they have over 400,000 users in 175 countries. Their lessons and tools have been translated into other languages through collabortions with students and adults worldwide. In 2018, a spinoff called FLLTutorials.com was launched to focus on resources for FIRST LEGO League.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Not the Droids You Are Looking For has a long
            history in youth robotics. Their FIRST LEGO League team (Not the Droids You Are Looking For) won the prestigous Champion's award at World Festival (Top team out of 38,000+ teams).
            They have won a Champion's and Robot Performance award every year in the program for seven straight years. They have also won First Place Programming and the Coach/Mentor Award at FIRST World Championships.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The Seshan Brothers (pictured above) who founded the site in 2014 have also built and programmed robots that have been featured on Discovery Channel, Popular Mechanics, World Robot Olympiad, LEGOWORLD Copenhagen, and World Maker Faires. They have beta-tested products for Carnegie Mellon University's Robotics Academy, Cogmation, Mindsensors, and other major companies. They have also been technical editors of a book related to MINDSTORMS and EV3 programming. They were named MINDSTORMS Community Partners (MCP) by the LEGO Group in 2017 for their expertise and contributions to the LEGO MINDSTORMS community.</p>
