<li>Refer to the <a href="RobotDesigns.html">Robot Design page on this site </a> for various base models that can be used with our lessons. If you are using an EV3, we recommend that you start with EV3 Enterprise, EV3 Discovery, DroidBot 2,0 or the base robot in the EV3 Education Core Set. If you are using an NXT, our lessons are based on Cyberbot.
